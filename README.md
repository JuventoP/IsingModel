# IsingModel
The Wolff Algorithm which is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to produce spin configs for the 3D Ising Model. Also includes how the implementation can be paralleleized across CPUs for computational speedup. The primary structure of the code is taken from https://hef.ru.nl/~tbudd/mct/lectures/cluster_algorithms.html
